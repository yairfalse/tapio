# Architecture Decision Record: Tapio Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

## Status
**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2024-01-10  
**Decision Makers**: Platform Engineering Team  
**Stakeholders**: SRE Team, Security Team, Development Team  

## Context

Tapio is an eBPF-based Kubernetes observability platform that requires deep kernel access and container runtime integration. The deployment strategy must balance security, performance, and operational complexity while providing comprehensive observability through OpenTelemetry integration.

## Decision Overview

We have decided to implement a **hybrid deployment architecture** with the following components:
- **DaemonSet** for eBPF collectors (node-level monitoring)
- **Deployment** for centralized OTEL collectors (aggregation and export)
- **StatefulSet** for persistent storage components (NATS, Neo4j)
- **Sidecar pattern** for node-level OTEL collection

## Decisions and Rationale

### 1. DaemonSet for eBPF Collectors

**Decision**: Deploy Tapio collectors as a DaemonSet with privileged security context.

**Rationale**:
- eBPF programs require kernel-level access on each node
- Host network and PID namespace access needed for comprehensive monitoring
- Ensures consistent deployment across all cluster nodes
- Provides node-level event correlation and context

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Complete node coverage
- ✅ Kernel-level observability
- ✅ Container runtime integration
- ❌ Requires privileged containers
- ❌ Security implications of host access

**Alternative Considered**: Deployment with node selectors
**Rejected Because**: Cannot guarantee coverage of all nodes, complex scheduling

### 2. Centralized OTEL Collector Deployment

**Decision**: Deploy OTEL collector as a Deployment with multiple replicas and HPA.

**Rationale**:
- Centralized aggregation reduces resource usage per node
- Horizontal scaling based on load
- Better resource utilization and cost optimization
- Simplified configuration management
- Load balancing across replicas

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Resource efficiency
- ✅ Horizontal scalability  
- ✅ High availability
- ❌ Network hop for telemetry data
- ❌ Single point of failure (mitigated by multiple replicas)

**Alternative Considered**: DaemonSet OTEL collectors
**Rejected Because**: Higher resource consumption, complex configuration distribution

### 3. Sidecar OTEL Pattern for Node-Level Collection

**Decision**: Deploy lightweight OTEL collectors as sidecars in the collector DaemonSet.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces network latency for high-volume telemetry
- Provides node-level aggregation and batching
- Enables local processing and filtering
- Maintains data locality for performance

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Low latency data collection
- ✅ Node-level aggregation
- ✅ Reduced network traffic
- ❌ Additional resource overhead per node
- ❌ More complex pod configuration

### 4. Network Security with NetworkPolicies

**Decision**: Implement zero-trust networking with comprehensive NetworkPolicies.

**Rationale**:
- Defense in depth security posture
- Microsegmentation of network traffic
- Compliance with security standards
- Reduced blast radius in case of compromise

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Enhanced security
- ✅ Regulatory compliance
- ✅ Traffic segmentation
- ❌ Increased complexity
- ❌ Potential connectivity issues during troubleshooting

**Alternative Considered**: Service mesh (Istio)
**Rejected Because**: Additional operational complexity, resource overhead

### 5. RBAC with Principle of Least Privilege

**Decision**: Implement fine-grained RBAC with minimal required permissions.

**Rationale**:
- Security best practices
- Compliance requirements
- Audit trail for permissions
- Reduced attack surface

**Components**:
- Separate ServiceAccounts for different components
- ClusterRoles with minimal required permissions
- Regular permission audits

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Security compliance
- ✅ Minimal attack surface
- ✅ Clear permission boundaries
- ❌ Complex permission management
- ❌ Potential issues during upgrades

### 6. Multi-Tier Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Use StatefulSets for persistent components with tiered storage.

**Components**:
- **NATS JetStream**: Fast SSD storage, 3-replica cluster
- **Neo4j**: High-performance storage for graph data
- **Logs**: Standard storage with rotation policies

**Rationale**:
- Data persistence and durability
- Performance optimization for different data types
- Cost optimization through storage tiering
- High availability through replication

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Data durability
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Cost efficiency
- ❌ Storage complexity
- ❌ Backup and recovery complexity

### 7. Monitoring and Observability Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus ecosystem.

**Components**:
- ServiceMonitors for automatic metrics discovery
- PrometheusRules for alerting
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Custom health checks

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard monitoring stack
- Native Kubernetes integration
- Extensive ecosystem and community
- Operational familiarity

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Mature ecosystem
- ✅ Native K8s integration
- ✅ Community support
- ❌ Resource overhead
- ❌ Prometheus scalability limits

### 8. Container Security Model

**Decision**: Use Pod Security Standards with privileged profile for collectors.

**Security Model**:
- **Collectors**: Privileged profile (required for eBPF)
- **OTEL Collectors**: Baseline profile
- **Storage Components**: Baseline profile
- **Support Services**: Restricted profile where possible

**Rationale**:
- Balance between security and functionality
- Compliance with security frameworks
- Clear security boundaries
- Graduated security model

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Security compliance
- ✅ Clear security model
- ✅ Minimal required privileges
- ❌ Complexity in security configuration
- ❌ Some components require elevated privileges

### 9. Resource Management Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive resource management with QoS classes.

**Resource Classes**:
- **Guaranteed**: Critical collectors and OTEL components
- **Burstable**: Storage components with variable load
- **BestEffort**: Optional components and testing

**Features**:
- CPU and memory limits for all components
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for OTEL collectors
- Pod Disruption Budgets for availability
- Resource quotas at namespace level

**Rationale**:
- Predictable resource usage
- Protection against resource starvation
- Cost optimization
- Performance guarantees

### 10. Deployment and Operations Strategy

**Decision**: Provide multiple deployment methods with comprehensive tooling.

**Deployment Methods**:
1. **Script-based**: For automated deployments
2. **Helm charts**: For template-based deployments  
3. **Manual**: For learning and debugging

**Operational Tools**:
- Health check scripts
- Deployment automation
- Cleanup procedures
- Performance monitoring

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility for different environments
- Operational efficiency
- Standardization and repeatability
- Reduced human error
