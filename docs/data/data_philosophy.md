## üé® Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Generic Observability
Traditional observability tools suffer from:
- **Data Overload**: Collecting everything, understanding nothing
- **Generic Schemas**: One-size-fits-none data models
- **Late Intelligence**: AI/ML as an afterthought, not built-in
- **Configuration Hell**: Endless knobs and settings before value

### Our OPINIONATED Solution
We make **strong, intelligent defaults** based on deep Kubernetes expertise:
- **Pre-filtered Data**: We know 97% of events are noise
- **Semantic Enrichment**: Events carry meaning, not just data
- **AI-First Design**: Every field optimized for correlation
- **Zero-Config Intelligence**: Works perfectly out of the box

---

## üîç What OPINIONATED Means

### 1. **We Decide the Schema**
```protobuf
// NOT OPINIONATED: Generic event
message Event {
  map<string, google.protobuf.Any> data = 1;  // Could be anything
}

// OPINIONATED: Purpose-built for K8s intelligence
message OpinionatedEvent {
  SemanticContext semantic = 1;       // ALWAYS need meaning
  BehavioralContext behavioral = 2;   // ALWAYS need actor info
  TemporalContext temporal = 3;       // ALWAYS need time patterns
  AnomalyContext anomaly = 4;         // ALWAYS need unusual signals
  StateContext state = 5;             // ALWAYS need state changes
  CorrelationContext correlation = 6; // ALWAYS need relationships
  AIFeatures ai_features = 7;         // ALWAYS need ML features
  CausalityContext causality = 8;     // ALWAYS need cause/effect
  ImpactContext impact = 9;           // ALWAYS need "why care?"
}
```

### 2. **We Embed Intelligence at Collection**
Instead of collecting raw data and hoping AI figures it out later:
- **Semantic Classification**: Events are classified into our opinionated taxonomy at collection time
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Deviation from normal is calculated immediately
- **Correlation Vectors**: Multi-dimensional correlation features pre-computed
- **Impact Assessment**: Business/technical/security impact scored upfront

### 3. **We Make Correlation Trivial**
Our opinionated structure means:
- **OOM ‚Üí Pod Restart**: Pre-correlated within 30-second windows
- **Network Timeout ‚Üí Service Degradation**: Automatically linked
- **CPU Throttle ‚Üí Response Time**: Causal relationship built-in
- **Error Spike ‚Üí Cascade Prediction**: Pattern detection included

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Opinions

### Philosophy: OPINIONATED but FLEXIBLE
```yaml
# Default opinions work for 90% of clusters
# Power users can tune everything

apiVersion: tapio.io/v1
kind: OpinionConfig
metadata:
  name: production-opinions
spec:
  # Correlation Windows (all tunable)
  correlations:
    oom_restart_window: 30s      # We believe OOM->restart happens in 30s
    cascade_failure_window: 5m   # We believe cascades develop in 5m
    network_timeout_window: 10s  # We believe network issues cluster in 10s
    
  # Anomaly Thresholds (all tunable)
  anomalies:
    memory_pressure: 90          # We believe 90% memory is critical
    cpu_throttle: 80            # We believe 80% CPU causes issues
    error_rate_spike: 0.1       # We believe 10% errors is abnormal
    
  # Behavioral Learning (all tunable)
  behavioral:
    learning_window: 7d         # We believe 7 days captures patterns
    deviation_sensitivity: 0.8  # We believe 80% deviation is unusual
    trend_detection_window: 1h  # We believe 1hr shows real trends
    
  # Prediction Horizons (all tunable)
  predictions:
    oom_horizon: 5m            # We believe we can predict OOM 5m ahead
    cascade_horizon: 2m        # We believe cascades are predictable 2m out
    anomaly_horizon: 10m       # We believe anomalies develop over 10m
```

### Configuration Levels
1. **Zero-Config**: Use our defaults (works great!)
2. **Profile-Based**: Choose a profile (sensitive, relaxed, performance)
3. **Fine-Tuned**: Adjust specific opinions
4. **Learned**: Let Tapio learn your cluster's patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Data Foundation Principles

### 1. **Semantic-First Design**
Every event MUST have semantic meaning:
```go
// Bad: Generic event type
event.Type = "error"

// Good: Semantic classification
event.Semantic.EventType = "resource.exhaustion.memory.heap"
event.Semantic.Intent = "debugging"
event.Semantic.Description = "Java heap exhaustion in payment-service"
```

### 2. **Behavioral Context Always**
Every event MUST identify the actor and their behavior:
```go
event.Behavioral.Entity = {
  ID: "pod:payment-service-7d4f9c6b4-xk9zt",
  Type: "pod",
  Hierarchy: ["cluster:prod", "namespace:payments", "deployment:payment-service"],
  TrustScore: 0.95,  // Historical reliability
}
event.Behavioral.BehaviorDeviation = 0.9  // Very unusual!
```

### 3. **Time Intelligence Built-In**
Every event MUST have temporal context:
```go
event.Temporal.Patterns = [
  {Name: "business_hours", Confidence: 0.9, Phase: 0.7},
  {Name: "daily_peak", Confidence: 0.85, Phase: 0.3},
]
event.Temporal.Periodicity = {
  Period: 24h,
  Confidence: 0.95,
  NextExpected: "2024-01-21T09:00:00Z",
}
```

### 4. **Anomaly Scoring Mandatory**
Every event MUST be scored for unusualness:
```go
event.Anomaly.AnomalyScore = 0.87  // Highly unusual
event.Anomaly.Dimensions = {
  Statistical: 0.9,   // 3 std devs from mean
  Behavioral: 0.85,   // Very different from usual
  Temporal: 0.8,      // Wrong time of day
  Contextual: 0.9,    // Unusual for this context
}
```

### 5. **Correlation-Ready Structure**
Every event MUST support multi-dimensional correlation:
```go
event.Correlation.Vectors = {
  Temporal: [0.8, 0.2, 0.1, ...],   // Time-based similarity
  Spatial:  [0.9, 0.7, 0.3, ...],   // Entity-based similarity  
  Causal:   [0.7, 0.6, 0.4, ...],   // Cause-effect similarity
  Semantic: [0.85, 0.75, 0.6, ...], // Meaning-based similarity
}
```

### 6. **Impact Assessment Required**
Every event MUST explain why we should care:
```go
event.Impact = {
  BusinessImpact: 0.9,     // Customer-facing service!
  TechnicalImpact: 0.7,    // Service degradation likely
  SecurityImpact: 0.1,     // Not security-related
  UserImpact: 0.8,         // Users will see errors
  RecommendedActions: [
    {Type: "immediate", Action: "Scale horizontally"},
    {Type: "investigate", Action: "Check for memory leaks"},
  ],
}
```

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### 1. **Event Collection**
```go
// At collection time, enrich EVERYTHING
func CollectEvent(raw RawEvent) OpinionatedEvent {
  event := OpinionatedEvent{
    ID: generateTimeOrderedUUID(),
    Timestamp: time.Now(),
  }
  
  // Semantic enrichment (MANDATORY)
  event.Semantic = semanticEnricher.Enrich(raw)
  
  // Behavioral analysis (MANDATORY)
  event.Behavioral = behaviorAnalyzer.Analyze(raw)
  
  // Temporal patterns (MANDATORY)
  event.Temporal = temporalDetector.Detect(raw)
  
  // Anomaly scoring (MANDATORY)
  event.Anomaly = anomalyScorer.Score(raw)
  
  // State tracking (MANDATORY)
  event.State = stateTracker.Track(raw)
  
  // Correlation vectors (MANDATORY)
  event.Correlation = correlationEngine.Prepare(raw)
  
  // AI features (MANDATORY)
  event.AIFeatures = featureExtractor.Extract(raw)
  
  // Impact assessment (MANDATORY)
  event.Impact = impactAssessor.Assess(raw)
  
  return event
}
```

### 2. **Configurable Opinions**
```go
// Load opinions from config
opinions := LoadOpinions("production")

// Override specific opinions
opinions.Set("correlations.oom_restart_window", 45*time.Second)
opinions.Set("anomalies.memory_pressure", 85)

// Apply learned adjustments
opinions.ApplyLearning(cluster.Observations)

// Use opinions in correlation
if event.TimeSince(lastOOM) < opinions.Get("correlations.oom_restart_window") {
  CorrelateAsOOMRestart(event, lastOOM)
}
```

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
```go
// Even with rich data, maintain <10Œºs per event
func OptimizedEnrichment(raw RawEvent) OpinionatedEvent {
  // Parallel enrichment
  var wg sync.WaitGroup
  event := OpinionatedEvent{}
  
  wg.Add(4)
  go func() { event.Semantic = enrichSemantic(raw); wg.Done() }()
  go func() { event.Behavioral = analyzeBehavior(raw); wg.Done() }()
  go func() { event.Temporal = detectTemporal(raw); wg.Done() }()
  go func() { event.Anomaly = scoreAnomaly(raw); wg.Done() }()
  
  wg.Wait()
  return event
}
```

# After observing your cluster for 30 days
learned_adjustments:
  correlations:
    oom_restart_window: 45s  # Your pods take longer to restart
  anomalies:
    memory_pressure: 85      # Your apps run fine at 85%
  behavioral:
    deviation_sensitivity: 0.7  # Your cluster is more dynamic
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **OPINIONATED = Intelligent Defaults**: We make smart choices so you don't have to
2. **Configurable = Flexible**: Every opinion can be tuned for your environment
3. **AI-First = Built for Correlation**: Every field designed for machine learning
4. **Performance = Production-Ready**: Rich data without performance penalty
5. **Learning = Adaptive**: Opinions improve based on your cluster's reality

Remember: Being OPINIONATED means we've done the hard work of figuring out what matters for Kubernetes observability. You get instant value with zero configuration, but complete control when you need it.
