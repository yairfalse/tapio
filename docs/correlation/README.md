## ðŸ§  How Correlation Works

The Tapio correlation engine uses advanced AI and machine learning to:

1. **Event Collection**: Gather events from multiple collectors (K8s, systemd, eBPF, CNI)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify temporal and causal relationships between events
3. **Context Enhancement**: Add Kubernetes and system context to events
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine the root cause of incidents and performance issues
5. **Predictive Insights**: Provide early warning signals for potential issues

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Real-time Correlation**: Process events as they arrive
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Consider time, source, context, and semantics
- **Kubernetes-native**: Deep understanding of K8s concepts and relationships
- **Semantic Understanding**: AI-powered analysis of event content and meaning
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probabilistic confidence in correlation accuracy

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

The correlation engine can be configured for:
- Correlation sensitivity and thresholds
- Time window analysis
- Event source prioritization
- Kubernetes context depth
- Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs

## ðŸ“Š Performance

- Designed for high-throughput event processing
- Sub-second correlation for real-time use cases
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Memory-efficient event buffering

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Comprehensive unit tests for correlation algorithms
- Integration tests with multiple collectors
- Performance benchmarks for various event volumes
- Chaos engineering for correlation accuracy under failure conditions
