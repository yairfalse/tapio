# Process Signals Observer

## Why This Exists

**The Problem**: "My container crashed with exit code 137 - why?"

**The Solution**: Complete signal attribution showing WHO killed it and WHY.

When containers die in production, knowing just the exit code isn't enough. You need to know:
- Who sent the signal that killed it?
- Was it the OOM killer? 
- Was it a manual kill command?
- Was it a parent process cleanup?
- What was the exact sequence of events?

This collector provides complete death intelligence for every process in your cluster.

## What It Collects

### Process Lifecycle Events
- **Process Exec**: New process started with full context
- **Process Exit**: Process terminated with exit code and resource usage
- **Signal Generation**: WHO sent WHAT signal to WHOM
- **Signal Delivery**: When signals are actually delivered
- **OOM Kills**: Complete attribution of memory-related deaths
- **CPU Throttling**: Container resource limit violations

## Business Value

### Before Process Signals Observer
```
Container died: exit code 137
Developer: "Was it OOM? Manual kill? Parent cleanup?"
SRE: "No idea, logs are gone"
Result: Hours of debugging, no root cause
```

### After Process Signals Observer
```
Container died: exit code 137 (SIGKILL)
Signal sent by: PID 1234 (kubelet)
Reason: Memory limit exceeded (OOM)
Parent: kube-proxy cleanup routine
Result: Root cause identified in seconds
```

## Technical Implementation

### eBPF Programs
- `runtime_monitor.c`: Kernel-level signal tracking
- Tracepoints: `sched_process_exec`, `sched_process_exit`, `signal_generate`, `signal_deliver`
- Kprobes: `oom_kill_process` for OOM attribution

### Event Structure
```go
type ProcessSignalEvent struct {
    Timestamp   uint64      // When it happened
    EventType   string      // process_exec, process_exit, signal_sent, etc.
    PID         uint32      // Process ID
    TGID        uint32      // Thread group ID (main process)
    PPID        uint32      // Parent process ID
    Command     string      // Process name
    ExitInfo    *ExitInfo   // Exit code decoding
    SignalInfo  *SignalInfo // Signal details
    SenderPID   uint32      // Who sent the signal
    IsOOMKill   bool        // OOM killer involved
}
```

### Exit Code Decoding
The collector automatically decodes Linux exit codes:
- Exit code 0: Successful exit
- Exit code 1-255: Application-specific errors
- Exit code 137: SIGKILL (128 + 9)
- Exit code 143: SIGTERM (128 + 15)
- Core dumps detected and reported

## Integration with Tapio

### Correlation Engine
Process signal events feed into Tapio's correlation engine to:
- Link container deaths to resource exhaustion
- Correlate OOM kills with memory metrics
- Track cascading failures from parent to child processes
- Build dependency graphs of process relationships

### OpenTelemetry Metrics
- `runtime_events_processed_total`: Total runtime events
- `runtime_process_exits_total`: Process terminations by exit code
- `runtime_signals_sent_total`: Signals by type and sender
- `runtime_oom_kills_total`: OOM killer activations

## Performance Characteristics

### Overhead
- eBPF programs run in kernel space: ~100ns per event
- Ring buffer: 512KB for high-volume events
- Selective filtering: Only fatal signals tracked by default

### Scalability
- Tested with 10,000+ processes
- Handles fork bombs and process storms
- Automatic event rate limiting

## Configuration

```go
type Config struct {
    BufferSize  int  // Event buffer size (default: 10000)
    EnableEBPF  bool // Enable kernel monitoring (default: true)
}
```

## Usage Example

```go
collector, err := NewCollector("runtime-signals")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

ctx := context.Background()
if err := collector.Start(ctx); err != nil {
    return err
}

// Process events
for event := range collector.Events() {
    if event.Type == EventTypeProcessExit {
        fmt.Printf("Process %s (PID %d) exited with code %d\n",
            event.Process.Command,
            event.Process.PID,
            event.Process.ExitCode)
            
        if event.Process.ExitCode == 137 {
            // Check who sent SIGKILL
            fmt.Printf("Killed by: PID %d\n", event.Process.KillerPID)
        }
    }
}
```

## Debugging Guide

### Common Exit Codes
- **Exit 0**: Normal termination
- **Exit 1**: General errors
- **Exit 2**: Misuse of shell builtins
- **Exit 126**: Command cannot execute
- **Exit 127**: Command not found
- **Exit 128+n**: Terminated by signal n
- **Exit 137**: SIGKILL (OOM or manual kill)
- **Exit 143**: SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)

### Signal Attribution
When a process dies from a signal, the collector shows:
1. The exact signal number and name
2. The PID that sent the signal
3. Whether it was the OOM killer
4. The parent process context
5. Resource usage at time of death

## Architecture Notes

### Level 1 Collector
This is a Level 1 collector in Tapio's architecture:
- Can only import from `pkg/domain` (Level 0)
- Provides raw runtime events to higher levels
- No business logic, just data collection

### Platform Support
- **Linux**: Full eBPF support with all features
- **Darwin/Windows**: Gracefully degraded (no eBPF)

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
go test -race -cover ./...

# Benchmark
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Integration test (Linux only)
sudo go test -tags=integration ./...
```

## Metrics Dashboard

Key metrics to monitor:
```
rate(runtime_process_exits_total[5m]) # Death rate
sum by (signal) (runtime_signals_sent_total) # Signals by type
runtime_oom_kills_total # OOM incidents
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Container runtime integration (containerd, CRI-O)
- [ ] Kubernetes pod correlation
- [ ] Resource limit violation tracking
- [ ] Syscall failure attribution
- [ ] Network connection teardown tracking

## Contributing

When modifying this collector:
1. Maintain 80% test coverage
2. No TODOs or stubs
3. Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines
4. Update eBPF programs carefully (kernel code)
5. Test on multiple kernel versions
