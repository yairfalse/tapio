// REMOVED: This massive 228-line stub file has been eliminated as part of the stub-free architecture redesign.
// The journald collector with extensive mock event generation has been replaced with:
// - Clear capability error reporting for non-Linux platforms
// - Real journald integration on Linux in pkg/capabilities/plugins/
// - No more fake events or mock data generation
// Use capabilities.RequestSystemMonitoring() for cross-platform system monitoring.
