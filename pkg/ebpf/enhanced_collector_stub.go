// REMOVED: This stub file has been eliminated as part of the stub-free architecture redesign.
// The 77+ lines of fake enhanced collector implementation have been replaced with:
// - Plugin-based architecture in pkg/capabilities/plugins/
// - Clear error reporting instead of fake event generation
// - Real Linux eBPF implementation or clear platform unavailability
