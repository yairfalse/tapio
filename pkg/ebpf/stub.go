// REMOVED: This stub file has been eliminated as part of the stub-free architecture redesign.
// The stubMonitor with 47+ lines of no-op implementations has been replaced with:
// - Clear capability error reporting using pkg/capabilities.CapabilityError
// - Plugin-based architecture that avoids fake implementations entirely
// - Meaningful error messages instead of silent no-ops
