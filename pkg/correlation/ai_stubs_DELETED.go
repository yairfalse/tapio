// This file replaces ai_stubs.go which has been removed for clean next-version AI integration
// The 630+ lines of AI stub code have been eliminated to remove technical debt
//
// AI will be implemented properly in the next version with:
// - Real feature engineering (not stubs)
// - Production ML models (not placeholders)  
// - Vector embeddings and graph processing
// - Clean architecture without stub dependencies
//
// Current version provides production-ready correlation without AI complexity
