// This file replaces ai_ready.go which has been removed for clean next-version AI integration
// The AI processor that depended on stub implementations has been eliminated
//
// Next version will implement proper AI integration:
// - Production-grade ML pipelines
// - Real feature processing 
// - Semantic embeddings and graph analysis
// - Clean separation between correlation and AI layers
//
// Current architecture provides excellent correlation capabilities without AI dependencies
