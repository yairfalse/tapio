## Recent Test Activity

### Fixed Tests
1. **systemd processor tests** - Updated for UnifiedEvent migration
2. **correlation service tests** - Fixed interface conflicts

### Tests Needing Attention
1. Many tests may be failing due to UnifiedEvent migration
2. New packages (security, config) need comprehensive test coverage

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add tests for new packages**:
   - `pkg/integrations/config` - Critical configuration framework
   - `pkg/integrations/security` - Security hardening components
   - `pkg/integrations/monitoring` - Monitoring framework

2. **Fix failing tests**:
   - Run full test suite to identify failures
   - Update tests for UnifiedEvent migration

### Medium Priority
1. **Add tests for interfaces**:
   - CLI components
   - Client libraries
   - Core interfaces

2. **Add tests for persistence**:
   - WAL implementation
   - Storage interfaces

### Low Priority
1. **Add tests for stubs/examples**:
   - Platform-specific stubs
   - Example implementations

## Test Coverage Goals
- Aim for 80% test coverage per CLAUDE.md requirements
- Focus on critical business logic first
- Ensure all new code includes tests

## Next Steps
1. Run `go test ./pkg/... -cover` to get exact coverage percentages
2. Create test templates for common patterns
3. Set up CI to enforce test coverage requirements
