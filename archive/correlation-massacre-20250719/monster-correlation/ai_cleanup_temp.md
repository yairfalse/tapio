# AI Components Removed - Ready for Next Version

## Files Removed:
- ai_stubs.go (630+ lines of stub code)
- ai_ready.go (AI processor that depends on stubs)

## Comments Updated:
- autofix_engine.go:14 (removed ai_stubs reference)
- engine.go:14 (removed ai_stubs reference)  
- pattern_engines.go:96 (removed ai_stubs reference)

## Benchmark Tests:
- perfect_engine_bench_test.go (AI benchmarks removed)

## Architecture Decision:
Clean separation - current version focuses on production-ready correlation without AI dependencies. 
Next version can add proper AI implementation without stub legacy.
