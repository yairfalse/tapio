## Detailed Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Well-Tested Packages (>70% coverage)
1. **k8s/core** - 100.0% coverage
2. **k8s** - 94.4% coverage
3. **intelligence/context** - 90.1% coverage
4. **cni** - 79.1% coverage

### ⚠️ Moderately Tested Packages (30-70% coverage)
1. **systemd/core** - 68.8% coverage
2. **systemd** - 60.0% coverage
3. **collector-manager** - 43.1% coverage
4. **common** - 39.4% coverage
5. **k8s/internal** - 38.9% coverage

### ❌ Poorly Tested Packages (<30% coverage)
1. **domain** - 19.4% coverage
2. **resilience** - 0.2% coverage
3. **Many packages with 0% or no tests**

### 🔴 Build Failures
The following packages have test build failures:
- collectors/cni/internal
- collectors/ebpf
- collectors/ebpf/internal
- collectors/systemd/internal
- integrations/collector-manager/examples
- integrations/config
- integrations/examples
- integrations/server
- intelligence/adapters
- intelligence/analytics/engine
- intelligence/correlation
- intelligence/extraction
- intelligence/performance
- intelligence/pipeline
- interfaces/server/grpc

### 📁 Packages Without Any Tests
- domain/events
- domain/validation
- integrations (root)
- integrations/config
- integrations/core
- integrations/monitoring
- integrations/otel
- integrations/security
- integrations/server
- intelligence/adapters
- intelligence/interfaces
- interfaces/client
- interfaces/config
- interfaces/core
- interfaces/logging
- persistence/wal

## Test Type Analysis

### Unit Tests
- **52 test files** found across the codebase
- Primary testing method used
- Focus on individual component testing

### Integration Tests
- **Only 1** integration test file found
- Significant gap in integration testing

### E2E Tests
- **0** E2E test files found
- No end-to-end testing coverage

### System Tests
- **1** system test directory found
- Minimal system-level testing

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions
1. **Fix Build Failures**: Address all test build failures, especially in critical packages like intelligence and integrations
2. **Add Missing Tests**: Priority packages needing tests:
   - persistence/wal (data persistence layer)
   - integrations/security (security components)
   - domain/validation (core validation logic)
   - interfaces packages (API contracts)

### Coverage Improvements
1. **Domain Package**: Increase from 19.4% to at least 80%
2. **Integrations**: Most sub-packages have 0% coverage
3. **Intelligence**: Fix build issues and ensure 70%+ coverage

### Test Type Gaps
1. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for:
   - Collector to pipeline integration
   - Intelligence to interfaces integration
   - Security and monitoring integration

2. **E2E Tests**: Create E2E tests for:
   - Full data flow from collectors to output
   - Configuration changes and hot reloading
   - Failure scenarios and recovery

3. **System Tests**: Add system tests for:
   - Multi-collector scenarios
   - Performance under load
   - Security hardening validation

### Quick Wins
1. Add tests for small, isolated packages first
2. Fix build failures in test files
3. Add basic unit tests for packages with 0% coverage
4. Create test templates for common patterns
