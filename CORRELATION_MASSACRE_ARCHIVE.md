## What We Extracted First

Before deleting, we extracted these gems:
1. **Human-readable output** (~400 lines)
2. **Predictive OTEL metrics** (~500 lines)
3. **Semantic OTEL trace correlation** (~600 lines)

Total extracted: ~1,500 lines of innovation

## Efficiency: 97.8% code reduction!

## Archive Created: 
Date: $(date)
Reason: 68K lines of over-engineered correlation replaced by 477-line production engine
