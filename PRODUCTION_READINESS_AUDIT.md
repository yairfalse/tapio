# Tapio eBPF Production Readiness Audit

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the Tapio eBPF implementation, I've identified critical gaps that must be addressed before production deployment in large Kubernetes clusters.

## Critical Missing Functionality (P0 - Must Fix)

### 1. Container Runtime Integration ❌ CRITICAL
**Current State**: No actual container runtime integration - using placeholder cgroup ID hashing
**Impact**: Cannot correlate kernel events to actual containers/pods
**Required Actions**:
- Implement CRI (Container Runtime Interface) client for containerd/CRI-O
- Add Docker API client for legacy clusters
- Implement cgroup v2 path resolution
- Add runtime auto-detection

### 2. IPv6 Support ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Current State**: Only IPv4 support in network monitoring
**Impact**: Cannot monitor IPv6-only or dual-stack clusters
**Status**: Basic structures added, needs full implementation

### 3. Error Recovery & Fallback ❌ CRITICAL
**Current State**: No graceful degradation if eBPF programs fail to load
**Impact**: Complete collector failure on unsupported kernels
**Required Actions**:
- Implement feature detection (BTF, kernel version)
- Add fallback to kprobes if fentry/fexit unavailable
- Implement partial functionality mode
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### 4. Resource Limits & Safety ❌ CRITICAL
**Current State**: No safeguards against resource exhaustion
**Impact**: Can cause OOM or CPU starvation
**Required Actions**:
- Add memory usage monitoring for ring buffers
- Implement CPU usage throttling
- Add event rate limiting per container
- Implement automatic sampling adjustment

### 5. Security Event Coverage ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Current State**: Basic security monitoring, missing critical events
**Missing Coverage**:
- Container escape detection (namespace breakout)
- Seccomp violations
- AppArmor/SELinux denials
- Suspicious file access patterns
- Network policy violations

## High Priority Gaps (P1 - Production Blockers)

### 6. Data Loss Detection ❌ MISSING
**Current State**: No tracking of dropped events
**Impact**: Silent data loss under load
**Required**: Per-CPU drop counters, ring buffer overflow detection

### 7. OTEL Pipeline Integration ⚠️ BASIC
**Current State**: Basic trace/span ID generation
**Missing**:
- Proper OTLP export
- Metric aggregation
- Trace context propagation
- Resource attributes

### 8. Kubernetes Metadata Enrichment ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Current State**: Basic pod/service mapping
**Missing**:
- ReplicaSet/Deployment hierarchy
- Node metadata
- Cluster name/ID
- Custom labels/annotations

### 9. High Cardinality Handling ❌ MISSING
**Current State**: No cardinality controls
**Impact**: Memory explosion with millions of unique connections
**Required**: LRU eviction, aggregation, sampling

### 10. Modern Protocol Support ❌ MISSING
**Not Implemented**:
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 parsing
- gRPC method extraction
- WebSocket tracking
- QUIC support

## Production Deployment Gaps (P2)

### 11. Deployment Automation ❌ MISSING
**Missing**:
- Helm charts
- DaemonSet configurations
- RBAC templates
- Network policies
- Resource quotas

### 12. Multi-Architecture Support ⚠️ PARTIAL
**Current State**: x86_64 only
**Missing**: ARM64 builds, BTF generation per arch

### 13. Kernel Compatibility Matrix ❌ MISSING
**Required**: Testing on kernel versions 4.18 - 6.x

### 14. Performance Benchmarks ❌ INCOMPLETE
**Missing**: Production workload impact analysis

## Security Considerations (P3)

### 15. Sensitive Data Scrubbing ❌ MISSING
**Risk**: Capturing passwords, tokens, PII
**Required**: Data sanitization layer

### 16. Compliance Features ❌ MISSING
**Required for GDPR/HIPAA**:
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging
- Encryption at rest
- Access controls

## Operational Requirements (P4)

### 17. Observability of eBPF Programs ❌ MISSING
**Required**:
- Program load/unload metrics
- Verifier rejection reasons
- CPU usage per program
- Map usage statistics

### 18. Configuration Management ⚠️ BASIC
**Missing**:
- Hot reload without restart
- ConfigMap integration
- Feature flags
- A/B testing support

### 19. Documentation ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Missing**:
- Deployment guide
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tuning guide
- Security hardening guide

## Critical Code Implementation Needed

### Priority 1: Container Runtime Integration
- CRI client implementation
- Cgroup v2 resolver
- Container lifecycle hooks

### Priority 2: Error Recovery System
- Kernel feature detection
- Graceful degradation logic
- Retry mechanisms

### Priority 3: Resource Management
- Memory limiter
- CPU throttling
- Rate limiting

### Priority 4: Data Pipeline
- OTLP exporter
- Batching logic
- Compression

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Must Have Before Production
- [ ] Container runtime integration
- [ ] Error recovery and fallback
- [ ] Resource limits and monitoring
- [ ] Data loss detection
- [ ] Security event full coverage
- [ ] IPv6 support completion
- [ ] OTEL pipeline completion
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Performance impact < 2% CPU

### Should Have
- [ ] Modern protocol support
- [ ] High cardinality handling
- [ ] Multi-architecture support
- [ ] Kernel compatibility testing
- [ ] Sensitive data scrubbing

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Advanced security detection
- [ ] ML-based anomaly detection
- [ ] Custom eBPF program loading
- [ ] Service mesh integration

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Production Outage**: eBPF program crash causing kernel panic
2. **Data Loss**: Silent event drops under load
3. **Security Breach**: Missing critical security events
4. **Performance Impact**: Excessive CPU/memory usage

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Implement comprehensive testing on staging clusters
2. Add circuit breakers and rate limiting
3. Deploy with gradual rollout
4. Monitor closely with kill switches

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Week 1)**:
   - Implement container runtime integration
   - Add error recovery system
   - Complete IPv6 support

2. **Short-term (Weeks 2-3)**:
   - Add resource management
   - Implement data loss detection
   - Complete OTEL integration

3. **Medium-term (Month 2)**:
   - Add deployment automation
   - Complete security coverage
   - Performance optimization

4. **Long-term (Month 3+)**:
   - Modern protocol support
   - Advanced features
   - Production hardening

## Conclusion

The Tapio eBPF implementation has a solid foundation but requires significant work before production deployment. The most critical gap is container runtime integration - without this, the system cannot properly correlate events to Kubernetes workloads.

Estimated time to production readiness: **6-8 weeks** with a dedicated team.
