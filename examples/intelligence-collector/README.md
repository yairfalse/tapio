# Intelligence Collector Example

This example demonstrates the intelligence-focused network collector.

**Status**: Currently being updated to match the latest CollectorEvent API.

The previous example has been temporarily disabled while we complete the systematic refactoring of the collector system.

To run the intelligence collector, see the tests in `pkg/collectors/network/` for current usage patterns.

## What this example will demonstrate:

1. Service dependency discovery
2. Error pattern detection  
3. Latency anomaly detection
4. DNS failure correlation
5. Security concern identification

The example will be restored once the collector API stabilization is complete.
